# Kaixing Cao's Academic Homepage

This is my personal academic homepage, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  

The design and functionality were inspired by [AcademicPage](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), but the site was built from scratch with assistance from [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/).

## Features
- **Theme Switching**: The site provides two color themes (light and dark), which can be toggled using the button in the navigation bar. The button icon indicates the current theme.

- **BibTeX**: Expandable BibTeX entries for each publication, with copy-to-clipboard button.
